Just stickers, nothing else.

### Introduction
How many sticker packs do you have?  Two three?  More than five?  Then maybe you are faced with the fact that you need to choose a sticker with "surprise", but for this you need to first select the sticker pack, then find the sticker in it.  You can of course try to find the right sticker for emoji, but they are not always correctly selected, and it takes a long time to search for emoji.  This is the hard way.

It would be much more logical to have a sorting by the content of the stickers, and then choosing a pack with "surprise" you could just choose the right one from a dozen options.  This is a more natural way.

### What will never be in these packs:
* erotica in any form
* stickers drawn not in anime similar style
* animated stickers
* stickers with any cyrillic/latin text 
* stickers with non transparent background
* stickers that simply do not meet our aesthetic criteria
